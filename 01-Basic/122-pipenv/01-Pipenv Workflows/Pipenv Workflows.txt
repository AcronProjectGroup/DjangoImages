Pipenv Workflows


Clone / create project repository:
    > cd myproject

Install from Pipfile.lock, if there is one:
    > pipenv sync

Add a package to your project, recalibrating entire lock file using the Pipfile specifiers:
    > pipenv install <package>

Update everything (equivalent to pipenv lock && pipenv sync):
    > pipenv update

Update and install just the relevant package and its sub-dependencies:
    > pipenv update <package>

Update in the Pipfile/lockfile just the relevant package and its sub-dependencies:
    > pipenv upgrade <package>

Find out whatâ€™s changed upstream:
    > pipenv update --outdated

Determine the virtualenv PATH:
    > pipenv --venv

Activate the Pipenv shell:
    > pipenv shell

Note: This will spawn a new shell subprocess, which can be deactivated by using exit.
